The goal of this R package is to provide options for researchers who want to explore differnt datasets on GLDS and continue their analysis using statistical learning models to detect distinct patterns in the dataset.  

This R pacakage includes following contents step by step:
- Explore metadata of GLDS datasets 
- Download available csv datsets using RestAPI 
- Review target dataset
- Outlier detection
- Representation learning
- Clustering
- Visualization
